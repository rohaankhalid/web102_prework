## Notes

During the development process, I encountered the following challenges:

1. **Understanding the DOM manipulation**: Ensuring the games were dynamically rendered and updated based on filters required careful testing and debugging.
2. **CSS alignment issues**: The alignment of the Stats section was tricky, but using Flexbox properties resolved it.
3. **JavaScript errors**: Debugging variable redeclaration errors and ensuring proper scoping helped improve the code.
